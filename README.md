# Echo-hello

[![Go](https://github.com/RIDOS/echo-hello/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RIDOS/echo-hello/actions/workflows/go.yml)

In this project we can see service written in framework [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) and use [ZeroLog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).

How it works? Project use port `:8080` and use endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

This endpoint output count days before start `2025` lear.

Also, we can use endpoint with header like this:
```bash
curl -H "User-Role: Admin" http://localhost:8080/status
```

And then we can see in server console output:
```bash
â‡¨ http server started on [::]:8080
5:47AM WRN red button user detected
```
